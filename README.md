# GameProjects

These are some game projects that I've worked on in my classes! All were made using Unity.

## Installation
To access the project files itself, simply pull from the repository. You can look through the scripts, sprites, animations, etc. for each game.

To play the game, pull from the game's Build folder. I provided both a Windows and Mac build to play.
