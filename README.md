## Description

### Thanatos

**TRIGGER WARNING: SUICIDE, DEPRESSION**

[Official Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Zk2Fy-Nx4)

Thanatos is a 3D, first-person psychological horror puzzle game that I developed with my designer, Megan Yeh. The player gets a call from an unknown caller threatening to end their life on the roof of their school. The player must navigate through all 3 floors of the school where they must solve a series of puzzles to receive the key or code to advance to the next floor. The levels get increasingly harder and the player is faced with paranormal activities. 

I programmed the entirety of the game, including mechanics, object animations, transitions, and more. Megan was in charge of level design, narrative, character animations, sprites, and more. 

Music and SFX were composed by Brandon Skylar, Johnny (Tzu-Yang) Ho, Josh Nichol, and Tate Friedlineâ€” a team of students from the Berklee School of Music. 

The school environment came from the [JapaneseSchool](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/japanese-school-stylized-221256) asset by Sherman Waffle Studios. The padlock, keypad, and chest came from the [Horror FPS Kit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/horror-fps-kit-82643) asset by ThunderWire Studios. Both assets were downloaded from Unity Store.

### Cloud Hop

Cloud Hop is another original game that I developed with Megan Yeh. The player must navigate through each maze and get to the door in a way where they step on each cloud. Players get three lives per level, and the levels get increasingly harder with added components (clouds to step on twice, lock & key). 

The game was inspired by Club Penguin's "Thin Ice" and the theme was inspired by Studio Ghibli's "My Neighbor Totoro." 

I programmed the entirety of the game. Sprites and animations were created by Megan Yeh. The background music came from "My Neighbor Totoro" and sound FX came from various YouTube clips.

### Frogger

This is a remake of the classic arcade game, Frogger. I developed this with my partner, Christian Trinh-Tran. The player must hop through traffic and through water using logs/turtles to reach all 5 homes. Players must reach a home within a certain amount of time, and they only get 3 lives total. 

Sprites came from Zigurous, a YouTuber who uploaded a tutorial for the game. Music and sound FX came from ClassicGaming.cc.
