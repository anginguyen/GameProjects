# GameProjects

These are some game projects that I've worked on in my classes! All were made using Unity.


## Description
### Cloud Hop
Cloud Hop is original game that I developed with my partner, Megan Yeh. The player must navigate through each maze and get to the door in a way where they step on each cloud. Players get three lives per level, and the levels get increasingly harder with added components (clouds to step on twice, lock & key). 

The game was inspired by Club Penguin's "Thin Ice" and the theme was inspired by Studio Ghibli's "My Neighbor Totoro." 

Sprites and animations were created by Megan Yeh. The background music came from "My Neighbor Totoro" and sound FX came from various YouTube clips.

### Frogger
This is a remake of the classic arcade game, Frogger. I developed this with my partner, Christian Trinh-Tran. The player must hop through traffic and through water using logs/turtles to reach all 5 homes. Players must reach a home within a certain amount of time, and they only get 3 lives total. 

Sprites came from Zigurous, a YouTuber who uploaded a tutorial for the game. Music and sound FX came from ClassicGaming.cc.

## Installation
To play the game, pull from the game's Build folder. I provided both a Windows and Mac build to play.

To access the project files itself, simply pull from the repository. You can look through the scripts, sprites, animations, etc. for each game.
