# GameProjects

These are some game projects that I've worked on in my classes! All were made using Unity.

## Description
### Frogger

### Cloud Hop
Cloud Hop is original game that I developed with my partner, Megan Yeh. The player must navigate through each maze and get to the door in a way where they step on each cloud. Players get three lives per level, and the levels get increasingly harder with added components (clouds to step on twice, lock & key). 

The game was inspired by Club Penguin's "Thin Ice" and the theme was inspired by Studio Ghibli's "My Neighbor Totoro." 

Sprites and animations were created by Megan Yeh. The background music came from "My Neighbor Totoro" and sound FX came from various YouTube clips. 



## Installation
To access the project files itself, simply pull from the repository. You can look through the scripts, sprites, animations, etc. for each game.

To play the game, pull from the game's Build folder. I provided both a Windows and Mac build to play.
